Hi, <br>
In this Post I am going to write about my workflow and how I organize myself with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

### What is Obsidian? <br>
Obsidian is a note-taking tool. The Website states, "your second brain". This explains what Obsidian is all about.<br>
Our brain works, by linking all the information we have to store with each other. (I am no neurologist, that's all I can give you). If I learn something about Physics for example Waves my brain will link that with waves in the ocean. If I think about waves I imagine the waves on the ocean. <br>
Obsidian works just like that. My Obsidian Vault(Just a folder where you store all your Data), are a lot of files, that are linked to each other. Over some time my "Second Brain" began forming and building a network out of notes and files.

### Why should you use Obsidian? <br>
To answer this question let me tell a story of my note-taking before I used Obsidian. <br>
I wrote every file in LaTeX, (that's a display language to create pdfs) and I wrote a File, put in a folder and left it there untouched. I wasn't happy with a system that was after all useless to me, because I never touched these notes again. So I started using Obsidian, and I loved it. I could update, sort and rewrite all the files I wanted to, could link them to each other and they were all connected and most importantly for me, they were all in one place. <br>
<br>
So that's my Reason to use Obsidian for my daily note-taking. 

### Endless Possibilities
After some time I got pretty fluent in using Obsidian and I started using extensions, made from the community, there are over 500 community addons and they are all useful. 
<br>
After some time I got a lot of extensions installed and used them every day. 

### Organizing my life with Obsidian
Now I started using Obsidian for managing and organizing my file, my goals, my todos and everything that was important to me. I used extensions like a Calendar or a [Kanban Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board), to organize myself.
<br> <br>
I will need some time to get myself used to this kind of organization, but I think I am on a good path to finally find peace in organizing myself.
